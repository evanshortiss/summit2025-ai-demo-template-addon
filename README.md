# LangChain AI Agent Python - Backstage Template

This is a Backstage Software Template for creating AI-powered agents that monitor Kafka topics, analyze failed message routing, and send notifications to Backstage Users/Groups. The template provides a complete solution for building, deploying, and managing Python-based LangChain agents on OpenShift.

Add the [template.yaml URL](https://github.com/evanshortiss/summit2025-ai-demo-template-addon/blob/main/template.yaml) to your Developer Hub instance using the **Register Existing Component** button in the UI or in the `catalog.locations` in the configuration YAML. Make sure to fork this repository and update the Quay and GitLab URLs in the _template.yaml_ to match your cluster's values prior to importing.
